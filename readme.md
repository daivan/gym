# For future installations regarding stable-baselines3
You want to install stable-baselines3 v2.x.x but it is currently only in alpha. Hopefully by the time you read this it is released. If it is, then you can just install it with pip. If not, then you need to install it.

# Activate tensorboard
to run the webserver for tensorboard go to the program that is currently logging and run this command
```
tensorboard --logdir=logs
```
Make sure that port 6006 is not in use. If it is, you can change the port with the --port flag.

Where logs is the folder where the logs are currently generated.

It will prompt you with this
```
Serving TensorBoard on localhost; to expose to the network, use a proxy or pass --bind_all
TensorBoard 2.12.1 at http://localhost:6006/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

# Start the program with a specific model
Lets say that you have trained the model and you want to test it. Make sure you have a `run_model.py`
```
python run_model.py
```
